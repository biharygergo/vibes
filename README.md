# The Vibe Project

## Deployed version
Check out the deployed prototype [here](https://getthevibe.today). It's best to use a mobile to test, we didn't really design for desktop.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The new status quo with Covid-19
2020 is crazy. Our lives have turned upside down, due to lockdowns and strict restrictions, most of us are confined to the 4 walls of our homes and the number of social interactions were drastically reduced. It is already proven that this prolonged solitary lifestyle is not healthy in the long run and it can heavily impact our mental wellbeing. We tend to turn inwards, communicate less with our friends and family; experience lack of motivation and energy; or fall into lazy habits. 

## How can VIBE help?
We started off by interviewing more than 15 students to gain a deep understanding on the daily issues of remote learning. During our prototyping phase these participants continuously validated the progress of the product.
By the end of the weekend, - based on the above insights - we created a simple app that can cheer you up during the moody afternoons. You can get pumped with motivation and energy from the videos that friends and university peers send you and you can keep the chain going by passing the vibes on to others. You can also see the entire communityâ€™s vibe with different sizes indicating the most dominant states.  

## How does it work?
After downloading Vibe and signing into your university network (e.g. Moodle), Vibe can start analysing your study load based on assignment deadlines and exams. When the app sees that you have several deliverables in the next few days, it can be assumed that you may encounter challenges like procrastination, unproductivity or anxiousness about failure. Vibe will gauge your mental state in simple steps and if needed, let your friends and university peers know that you could use the extra motivation so they can send you short good-vibe videos to cheer you up. Riding the wave, you can also choose to keep the game going by sending a video to others who are in the same boat as you. 

## What did we build in 24 hours?
The Vibe app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) created with React. The prototype has been developed to support the full user journey: adding your current Vibe, viewing your statistics and sending and receiving video Vibes. The app makes use of advanced browser APIs to view and record videos and has a Firebase backend to handle storage needs. 

## Who is behind Team Discover?
We have multiple years of experience in hackathons and real life projects, with Junction Connected being our 4th Junction participation. Our team combines a multi-disciplinary knowledge of full-stack development, machine learning, design and business development. We are double-degree EIT Digital students at top universities, including Aalto, KTH, TU/e, or TUB.

## What's next for VIBE?
A possible feature is sending analysis to teachers about how they can optimize their study plans to decrease stress factors. Another is connecting students who are equally frustrated and burnt-out so they can share their deeper underlying problems with each other.
